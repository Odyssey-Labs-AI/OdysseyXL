## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
### Option 1:
To get started with any OdysseyXL model, install the `diffusers` library and load the model using the following example:

```bash
pip install diffusers
```

Now we can the generation script. For this example we will use OdysseyXL-3.0

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aayan-Mishra/OdysseyXL.git
cd OdysseyXL
python3 download-and-infrence.py
```
### Option 2:
In this option you can use the new OdysseyXL API (Part of spestly package. Only supports 3.0+)!

```bash
pip install spestly
```

Now that we have the API system installed, we can now use it! A demo is shown below:

```python
from spestly import OdysseyXL

odysseyxl = OdysseyXL()

# Define the prompt and negative prompt
prompt = (
    "An amateur cellphone photography of a black Ferrari. "
    "f8.0, Samsung Galaxy, noise, jpeg artefacts, poor lighting, low light, "
    "underexposed, high contrast"
)
negative_prompt = (
    "(octane render, render, drawing, anime, bad photo, bad photography:1.3), "
    "(worst quality, low quality, blurry:1.2), "
    "(bad teeth, deformed teeth, deformed lips), "
